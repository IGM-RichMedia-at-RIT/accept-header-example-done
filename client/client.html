    /*Our fetchRequest sending function. Read init first.

    This is a helper function that allows us to easily send HTTP requests using the Fetch API
    without having to rewrite all the code every time we want to make a request. It accepts a
    URL that we want to make a request to, as well as an acceptedType which we will use to tell
    the server what kind of data we want back.
    */
    const sendFetchRequest = (url, acceptedType) => {
      /*First, we need to configure some options for the request that we want to send.
        The "method" for an HTTP request defines the kind of request we want to make.
        In this case, we are making a GET request which gets data from the server.
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods

        We also define our headers object. Headers are just a collection of metadata that gets sent
        with our request. In this case we are setting the 'Accept' header, which basically tells the
        server what kind of data we want to get back. We are setting it equal to whatever gets passed in
        as the 'acceptedType' (which we set below in our sendJSON and sendXML arrow functions).
      */
      const options = {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {'Accept': acceptedType},
      }

      /*Once we set up our request options, we can use the fetch api to make a request to our server. We
        ask it to make a 'GET' request (defined in our options object) to the 'url' endpoint (which we
        passed in from our sendJSON and sendXML arrow functions below). We also ask it to send back the
        correct content type using the Accept header.

        fetch is an asynchronous call. This means that once the browser calls the following line of code,
        we have no idea how long it will actually take to run. That is because it is making a request to
        our server (a totally different program, usually running on a different machine), and factors like
        internet lag, server load, etc. could impact how quickly a response comes back.

        Because of this, we cannot just call our handler function on the next line. Instead, calling the fetch
        function immediately returns a "promise". A promise is a structure in JavaScript (and a number of other
        languages) used to manage and track the completion (or failure) of asynchronous code.

        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
      */
      const fetchPromise = fetch(url, options);

      /*Once the above line of code has run, the process of sending a request to the server has begun. Note
      that I say "begun" because we do not know when it will actually finish. All we have is our promise object,
      which we can use to keep an eye on the asynchronous code our computer is now running.

      Promises have a lot of features and functions (check out the link above), but the one we will worry about
      for now is the .then() function. .then() is a way of setting up an event handler within our promise. This
      is very similar to the .addEventListeners we used on our buttons in init below. the .then() event is fired
      by the promise when our asynchronous code successfully completes. In this scenario, we would say the promise
      has been "fulfilled".

      In the case of our fetch promise, .then() will be called when we get a response from the server that we
      made a request to. Once we get a response from the server, we will call the callback function defined in
      our .then() handler below. In this case, it takes the response and calls the handleResponse function().
      */
      fetchPromise.then((response) => { handleResponse(response) });
    };



    /*Our init function is the starting point for our client side code. You can see just below the function that
      window.onload is set equal to init. This means that when the window loads, the init function is called.
    */
    const init = () => {
      //First we grab references to the two buttons in our HTML below.
      const jsonButton = document.querySelector("#getCatsJSON");
      const xmlButton = document.querySelector("#getCatsXML");

      /*Next, we want to be able to run code when these buttons are pressed. To do this, we can use the
        .addEventListener function to add a 'click' event. We want this click event to call the sendFetchRequest
        function up above. However, when passing a "callback" function (a function that gets called by another
        function) into the addEventListener function, we can't pass in parameters.

        To get around this limitation, we can simply define new functions that take no parameters, that in turn
        call our function with the correct parameters. sendJSON and sendXML are two examples of this. When the
        sendJSON function is called, all it does is call sendFetchRequest with a url of '/cats' and an acceptedType
        of 'application/json'. sendXML does the same, but with an accepted type of 'text/xml'. 
        
        '/cats' is the url we want to make a request to. If I wanted to make a request to www.google.com/teapot, I
        would pass in 'www.google.com/teapot'. If I don't define an entire domain (something like www.google.com),
        what I am instead saying is "make a request to /cats at the same domain that my browser got this web page from".

        'application/json' and 'text/xml' are what are known as MIMEtypes. MIMEtypes are standardized strings for
        referring to various data formats.
      */
      const sendJSON = () => sendFetchRequest('/cats', 'application/json');
      const sendXML = () => sendFetchRequest('/cats', 'text/xml');

      //Now that we have our functions defined above, we can have our click events call them. When someone clicks
      //the button, the callback function will be called.
